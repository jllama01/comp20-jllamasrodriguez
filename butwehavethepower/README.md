I correctly implemented a website that has an HTML file which hadles video and sound. I was able to do this by using an event listener of type "timeupdate" with the video as the target and an anonymous function which is able to annotate the lyrics as they move along. The function is declared inside the addEventListener function itself. There is also an attached CSS file which add styling. I got help from people who answered my questions in piazza, but I did not discuss it with anyone directly. I consulted the double rainbow example provided by the instructor and consulted a W3schools and stack overflow about details concerning the CSS file. I spent approximately 15 hours in the lab because I struggle to make the anonymous function work.
