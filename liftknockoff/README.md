Josué Llamas Rodríguez
Every assignment shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
- I correctly inmplemented the front end of a car ride service. I have an HTML file with Javascript, and a CSS file with some styling. It correctly uses a google maps API to obtain a map and my location is extracted via the navigator.geolocation object. My location is sent to a server via a request API. My location appears on the map with a map icon and the cars with a car icon. The weinermobile appears with the weinermobile icon. Upon clicking my location, the username appears along with the distance from the weinermobile and the distance to the closest car or passenger, depending on what I am at the time. Everything works just fine. Only occasionally did the data displayed on the console was incorrect, but this was then corrected upon refreshing the page. However, overall everything appears to be working just fine. 


Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
- I go thelp from Piazza questions, from Kingsley when I attended his office hours, and from some websites listed on the assingment. I got the distance between calculations from the two websites listed in the assignment page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript, http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html. Some additional sources I consulted include the class Github examples and the google maps developer website: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers#icons

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
- I spent approximately 30 hours working on this assignment.
