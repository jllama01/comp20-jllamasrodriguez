What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
The purpose of this is to hold all the assignments completed throughout Comp20 Spring 2019

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignments were the assignment 1 and 3. Assignment 1 was particularly interesting because it was the first time I had ever created a website, and my first exposure to HTML and CSS. It was also very nice to know that it was something personal and that we could use for the years in the future. Assignment 3 was fun for me because I felt more in control of what was going on. Playing the role of the server-side was fun because I could control what gets dealt and what kind of input to receive. Whereas as the client-side in assignmet 2, I felt more lost and didn't understand where I was sending my information or what was done with it.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I feel like I have grown a lot in the course of this class. Prior to this class I had taken COMP 11 and 15, so I understood how coding fundamentals worked and how data could be organized in data structures, but I had no idea of how code could work in such dynamic places such as the Web. I learned about Git and Github, Javascript, JSON, HTTP, MONGODB, HTML, CSS, and many other things I had no idea about. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I think learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was particularly important, considering that everybody relies on websites and people focus a lot on the functioning and looks of a website. The idea of making a website before this class seemed alien and something only hardcore experts could do, and now I feel like I can talk about it and even create my own. Another thing I thought was particularly important was learning about the HTTP request/response process, as I don't think the common person realizes what truly is happening behind the scenes when someone types a URL in the web browser and hits "Enter". Understanding its function and limitations is critical for any organization that depends on databases and information processing. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I was particularly interested in the concept of local and online databases that can store anything. It was also interesting to learn about how they can be hacked and their vulnerabilities. I think I would like to understand have a NoSQL database compares to SQL databases and how they can be better used.
