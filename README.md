# comp20-jllamasrodriguez Lab 4

- Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

- Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

- Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

In this lab I correctly implemented Responsive Web Design Media Queries, which allowed me to 
set breakpoints of width to tell the program when to show what. I also correctly implemented CSS
Sprtes which allowed me to display four different images even though it was only a single image that
had to be downloaded. The images of Homer Simpson correctly transition as the web browser changes width. 
I didn't discuss nor collaborated but I did consult online sources such as Seo, CSS-tricks, and W3schools.
I approximately spent around 3 to 4 hours in this lab.
